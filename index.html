<!-- About Me Section -->

          <p class="titlea">About Me</p>

          <img border="10px" class="me" src= "img/me.PNG">
        </div>

          <p border="10px" id="about">My name is Gavin Arthur Kerrigan and I am 16 years old. I started to learn web coding about a year ago in the Freehold High School Web Design program.
          So far I created five websites in the program not counting this one. (PS, the window to the site is too small so everything is scaled WAY down)
         </p>

         <p class="title">Websites</p>

<!-- Website 1- About Me -->
        <iframe id="first" src="https://gavin64dd.github.io/AboutMe/"></iframe>

        <p id="firstt">This is my <a href="file:///G:/My%20Drive/Intro%20Web%20Design/1-About%20Me/index.html">first website</a> I made back in October of 2018, it really isn't good at all. But hey, humble beginnings and all.
                        It was a website about yourself and this informstion is very outdated even today. This shows I was able to change the background color, add tables. and use links. </p>

<!-- Website 2- Xenoblade -->
        <iframe id="xeno" src="https://gavin64dd.github.io/Xenoblade2/"></iframe>

        <p id="xenot">My <a href="file:///G:/My%20Drive/Intro%20Web%20Design/2-Tell%20a%20Story/index.html">second project</a> about trying to teach people something, and I decided to teach people how to play my favorite game, Xenoblade 2. As you can see, our Websites
                      at this point our websites weren't responsive so the website looks a little weird through the iframe.</p>


<!-- Website 3- Orlando -->
        <iframe id="city" src="https://gavin64dd.github.io/Orlando/"></iframe>

        <p id="cityt">My third site and first one with Bootstrap, it was about a travel guide about the location, I picked Orlando. A lot of the site looks a lot neater
              with the addition of the Bootstrap gride system and navbars.</p>


<!-- Website 4- Castlevania One-Pager -->

       <iframe id="vania" src="https://gavin64dd.github.io/Castlevania/"></iframe>

        <p id="vaniat">The <a href="file:///G:/My%20Drive/Intro%20Web%20Design/4-Scrolling%20One%20Pager/index.html"> forth website</a> I created, a one pager about the Netflix anime, Castlevania
                        I also able to use bootstrap more affectively and was able to use an animation towards the bottom of the page. I also self taught myself how to add the little icon in the tab called a favico.</p>


<!-- Website 5- Notendo -->
       <iframe id="vania" src="https://gavin64dd.github.io/Notendo/"></iframe>

        <p id="badt">My <a href="file:///G:/My%20Drive/Intro%20Web%20Design/5-Final%20Project/index.html"> final website</a> we had to complete over the summer. In my opinion, I think the Castlevania site was better.
                        I still think this website is good but doesn't add really any new code I didn't know prior to making it. The theme was a buissness, so I did a "bootleg" version of Nintendo.</p>
